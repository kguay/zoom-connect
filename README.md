*A new way to connect to Zoom meetings.*

Built using Hugo (gohugo.io), ZoomConnect is a static tool that allows users to easily schedule and connect to Zoom meetings. ZoomConnect works best with Zoom Rooms and organizational accounts that use a "personal" (fixed) Meeting ID for all meetings (vs. dynamic Meeting IDs that are different for each meeting).
